<h2> My Hobby </h2>
<div style="text-align: center"> <img src="images/ebaypic.png" alt="broken" height="350"> </div>
<h3> What is it? </h3>
<p> Something I spend a good aount of my time doing is going to thrift shops thrifting for things that are easy to resell. I sell them currently on a few diffrent websites one of those being Ebay which has been my main source of income but I also enjoy spending a lot of time doing it. </p> <br/>
<h3> How do I do it? </h3>
<p>My main ways of getting product for my store is by going to garage sales, thrift shops, botiques, and places like Marshalls and Ross. I have been doing this for about 2 and a half years now and have learned about so many different clothing items and what there worth is.  </p>
<p>one of my favorite things to find is anything under the Brooklyn Brothers brand as theyre stuff is usally pretty expensive and they use good materials like wool and cashmere. Which tend to bump the price of certain pieces. </p>
<p> Also another thing I always like looking for are shoes. shoes. and shoes. I have so many shoes and shoes are one of my top selling items. Marshalls and Ross have amazing deals on shoes and its easy to flip shoes for $50+ from that place you just have to get there early and know what to look for </p>
<div style="text-align: center"> <img src="images/marshallspic.jpg" alt="broken" height="350"> </div>
<h3>Why do I do it? </h3>
<p> The reason I do this is purely for my entertainment. I enjoy the hustle of making money in a way that is far from convenient. I enjoy watching the hardwork I do payoff and that is that. </p>
<h3>Is it profitable? </h3>
<p> When I first started it was far from profitable. But the more I got into it and understood shipping prices and figuring out if I would profit when shipping is included. I also learned how to ship things for the least amount of money and that came when I learned about poly mailers and printing shipping labels. </p>
<p> So, yes, would be the answer to this  as I have made a couple grand this year alone. </p>

<h3>Shipping issues?</h3>
<p> I do not have any real shipping issues  as I have a good system for shipping things. The only issues that happen every once in a while is a customer telling me that there item got lost in the mail and I provide refunds for them. </p>
