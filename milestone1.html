<h3>What is the idea? </h3>
	<p> Something that I have an issue with about some websites is that they are not clear or to the point.</p>
	<p> I really like the city of Charlotte and want to give recommendations of good places to eat in Charlotte as there are 100s of restaurants to choose from and people coming and exploring it for the first time would have some issues with picking places to eat.</p>
	<p>Picking places to eat is only the first part of my idea. The second part is helping people find cool things to do in Charlotte and around Charlotte. As I have had issues with finding things to do in Charlotte as Google isn't always 
	reliable in telling you all of the cool quirks and places to visit in Charlotte.</p>
	<h3>Who is the intended audience? </h3>
	<p>The intended audience for this website are people who are visiting Charlotte or already live in the Charlotte area. </p>
<h3>What type of content might be included in your site?</h3>
<p>The contents that will be on my website are lists of different things to do and recommendations of places that are good to eat at. Broken down into different categories based on price and location.</p>
<h3>Websites that have similar concepts or ideas</h3>
